<p class="TextStyle1">Hitachi’s NEXTA STA instruments make it easy to analyze the thermal behavior of materials, whether
	in development or in the production stage. With an unsurpassed level of baseline stability and world-class
	sensitivity, the NEXTA STA simultaneous gravimetric analyzer allows you to detect minute weight changes over a wide
	temperature range, ensuring the material meets the performance and quality standards required.</p>
<p class="TextStyle1">Delivering most advanced TGA and DSC applications within a single instrument, including
	decomposition temperature, phase transition in metals, melting point determination and specific heat capacity
	testing, up to 1500ºC, the NEXTA STA thermogravimetric analyzer’s range includes automation features and advanced
	software for ease of use. These features, coupled with a reliable, rugged design, means that the NEXTA STA slots
	easily into your polymer, pharmaceutical, food, electronics, ceramics and metals materials development and quality
	control.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold; text-transform:uppercase; padding: 1rem 0;">NEXTA STA: World-class performance in action
</h2>

<h4>BASELINE DRIFT AND STABILITY OF LESS THAN 10 µg</h4>
<p class="TextStyle1">Several technological developments contribute to the NEXTA STA’s unsurpassed baseline flatness.
</p>
<ul class="ListStyle1">
	<li>The horizontal design of the balance makes it less susceptible to ‘buoyancy’ effects which are often observed in
		vertical designs. </li>
	<li>Built-in thermogravimetry (TG) correction technology monitors changes in the reference sample and subtracts them
		from the sample readings to cancel out any drift due to expansion under high temperature.</li>
</ul>

	</div>
</div>
<br />

<h4>RAPID PURGE AND OPTION FOR MULTIPLE PURGE GASES IN A SINGLE EXPERIMENT</h4>
<p class="TextStyle1">Up to four mass flow controllers can be chosen for running experiments using multiple purge gases.
	The system allows for rapid purging of residual gases, such as oxygen, to speed up the measurement process and
	improve performance where eliminating atmospheric gases is essential.</p>

</div>
<br />

<h4>ADVANCED TEMPERATURE CONTROL</h4>
<p class="TextStyle1">The NEXTA STA thermogravimetric analyzer has a wide temperature range and will give high accuracy
	DSC, heat capacity and modulated DSC measurements up to 1500C. The analyzer also has functionality for isothermal
	and controlled high resolution TGA. This is where you can slow down the rate of temperature change in the region of
	interest to get better resolution and accelerate the temperature change outside this region for speed.</p>

<h4>POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY MADE EASY-TO-USE WITH NEXTA TA SOFTWARE</h4>
<p class="TextStyle1">We’ve developed the NEXTA TA software to accommodate different user levels. A guidance function
	will walk non-experts through a measurement aligned with standard test methods (such as JIS, ISO, ASTM), or your own
	customized test methods which can be easily programmed into the software. Take routine measurements at speed by
	setting up common measurement conditions in advance that users can quickly select for analysis.</p>
