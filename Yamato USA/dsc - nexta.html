<h2 style="font-weight: bold; text-transform:uppercase; padding: 1rem 0;">The technology behind world-class performance
</h2>
<p class="TextStyle1">These are the main technological developments behind the world-class performance of the NEXTA DSC
    range:</p>
<br />

<p><strong>UNIQUE SENSOR DESIGN FOR IMPROVED BASELINE REPEATABILITY, SENSITIVITY AND RESOLUTION</strong> </p>
<p class="TextStyle1">With a sensitivity of 0.2 µW and a time constant down to five seconds
    with enhanced peak function activated, the DSC200 is able to resolve minute thermal processes within complex
    materials, such as polymers.</p>
<p class="TextStyle1">Both sensors benefit from an advanced heat-flow centric design, which
    helps with repeatability and stability.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>INNOVATIVE FURNACE DESIGN INCLUDING DUAL COOLING SYSTEM</strong> </p>
<p class="TextStyle1">In both the NEXTA DSC600 and NEXTA DSC200, the furnace has been
    completely reconfigured with low heat-capacity, triple layer insulation to improve baseline reproducibility. This,
    together with the sensor innovation, gives a baseline repeatability of ±5 μW.</p>
<p class="TextStyle1">The furnace also allows for a dual cooling system which eliminates the
    need for manual switching of the cooling system and allows for a simple post-sale upgrade if your requirements
    change.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY MADE EASY-TO-USE WITH NEXTA TA SOFTWARE</strong> </p>
<p class="TextStyle1">We‘ve developed the NEXTA TA software to accommodate different user
    levels. A guidance function will walk non-experts through a measurement and calibration aligned with standard test
    methods (such as JIS, ISO, ASTM), or your own customized test methods which can be easily programmed into the
    software. Take routine measurements at speed by setting up common measurement conditions in advance that users can
    quickly select for analysis.</p>
