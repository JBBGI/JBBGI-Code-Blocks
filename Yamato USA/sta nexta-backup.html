<h3>1. World class baseline performance</h3>
<p class="TextStyle1">The NEXTA STA series incorporates a new balance control technology in addition to the horizontal
	digital dual beam system that has been well received in our previous models. Conventionally, baseline drift occurs
	due to hysteresis in the temperature program or surrounding environmental factors. However, by incorporating a new
	balance technology, the NEXTA STA series achieved baseline stability that is not affected by the temperature
	program.</p>

<h3>2. Broad measurement application using high temperature control technology</h3>
<div class="ColumnSet">
	<div class="Column1andHalf FirstItem">
		<p class="TextStyle1">The NEXTA STA series heating furnace has the improved temperature control technology which
			realizes several temperature programs, such as heating at a constant heating rate, repetition heating and
			cooling, heating up and hold isothermal, temperature modulated DSC, and controlled reaction rate thermal
			analysis.</p>

<h3>3. Available DSC measurement on the NEXTA STA series - Specific heat capacity measurement over the wide temperature
	range achieved by DSC</h3>
<p class="TextStyle1">The NEXTA STA series showcases an evolution from DTA to DSC, enabling simultaneous
	thermogravimetry and DSC measurement, which defines it from its predecessors. In addition, by using temperature
	modulated DSC, specific heat capacity measurements are achieved over a wide temperature range that cannot be
	measured by (the) standalone DSC.</p>

<h3>4. “Real View®” Sample Observation Option</h3>
<p class="TextStyle1">The well-received “Real View®” option has been further developed.<br />Not only are samples
	observed while measurements are in progress, but various analysis features have been incorporated, such as digital
	zoom, image analysis, length measurement capability, and color analysis, which can support a variety of
	applications.</p>
