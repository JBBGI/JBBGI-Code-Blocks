      <p>It&rsquo;s Star Wars Day, and we&rsquo;re taking a closer look at the science behind our favorite saga. We know
        you&rsquo;ve been asking these questions for years. Now you know...</p>

        <h3><strong>1. Could I own my own lightsaber one day?</strong></h3>

        <p>The question on everyone&rsquo;s minds! These glowing, 4-foot blades contain a ton of energy that can cut
          through flesh and melt metal, but don&rsquo;t run so hot that they burn the hand that holds them. Plus, they
          look super cool. But could we actually create one? Here&rsquo;s what science tells us&hellip;</p>

        <p>The lightsaber is the most iconic of all weapons in the galaxy far, far away.. But could they really
          exist?&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Scientists have (of course!) looked into it, and the short answer is&hellip; not quite (yet).&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s what we know: Lightsabers are a fixed length, super hot (but not hot enough to burn the hand
          that holds it), and can cut through all materials except other lightsabers.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Right now the only thing we have here on our planet that can (almost) cut as well as a lightsaber is plasma,
          the fourth state of matter and ionized gas. Plasma cutters are used in welding, to cut medals.&nbsp;</p>


      </div>
      <br />
    </div>


    <div class="text-box">
      <h2><strong>But there&rsquo;s a problem:</strong></h2>

      <p><strong>Heat</strong>: In order to work, plasma cutters must be hot. Really hot. Like, 40,000 degrees
        Fahrenheit hot...</p>

      <p>The plasma coming out of welding tools is also really small (a few millimeters wide), not quite the 3-4 feet we
        see Luke Skywalker using. Us earthlings also need to wear gloves and protective eyewear when using these tools.
        A beam of plasma the size of a lightsaber blade would likely produce enough heat to fry the hand of anyone
        holding it, making it a less-than-ideal weapon.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Power</strong>: A lightsaber made of plasma would need a ton of power (and a very large power source)
        to work. Plasma cutters we use are also connected to a car-battery sized source, which would kind of limit the
        leaps and jumps during a lightsaber duel (and lead to a lot of tripping over power cords!).&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Fights</strong>: It would be tough to duel with two plasma beams, since they would pass right through
        each other (making it a bit anticlimactic...).</p>

      <p>In conclusion, your dreams of lightsaber showdowns may have to wait. Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re
        comfortable being connected to a car-battery, tangled up in power cords, wearing fire-proof gear, and relying on
        a millimeter-sized plasma beam (that can&rsquo;t block your opponent&#39;s beam&hellip;).&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><strong>2. Can a planet really have two suns?</strong></h3>

        <p>In one of the most iconic scenes from the original movie, Luke Skywalker walks outside his uncle&rsquo;s farm
          to gaze at two suns on the horizon of his home planet of Tatooine. But can a planet have two suns?</p>

        <p>While our lightsaber battles may be on hold, it turns out that planets orbiting two or more stars is not pure
          fiction.</p>

        <p>In 2011, NASA&rsquo;s Kepler mission explored the Milky Way Galaxy, in search of other habitable planets.
          &nbsp;As part of this mission, they discovered a cold planet, made of half rock and half gas, that they named
          Kepler-16b.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>They may not have found Jabba the Hutt, but they did find something interesting. Kepler-16b was a
          circumbinary planet: a planet that orbits two stars, instead of one! This led to a series of other discoveries
          of planets orbiting two suns! The team&rsquo;s studies showed that up to half of all the stars in our galaxy
          are part of a binary star system!&nbsp;</p>
