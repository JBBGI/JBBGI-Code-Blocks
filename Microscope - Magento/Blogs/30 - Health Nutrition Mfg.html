      <p>The health and nutrition manufacturing industry is among the most regulated industries in the world. With a
        growing list of ingredient bans, ensuring an effective and safe product is at the top of the list. While some
        quality control and quality assurance companies continue using ocular equipment to complete material analysis,
        most QC and QA professionals are switching to digital microscopes for inspection to:</p>

      <p>How can a digital microscope benefit you? With the flexibility of modern digital technology and the precise
        nature of traditional microscopy, quality control and inspection can assess the small details, like identifying
        crystallized particles on supplemental tablets or spotting fine cracks in tablets that can lead to incorrect
        dosages, that make the most significant difference in the quality of manufactured health and nutrition products.

      <p>Choosing the right microscope for your quality control applications can be a challenging task. With all these
        features and models to sift through, it&rsquo;s tempting to just work with the conventional microscope
        instrument you already have, even when you know you could be doing better.</p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s why we do the leg work for you. Tell us what you need to inspect, and we&rsquo;ll find the best
        microscope for you. We have 25 years of experience helping quality control engineers and inspectors improve
        their processes with better microscopes. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Before you make a capital purchase for your quality control processes, give us a call. Save a chunk of your
        budget and put it towards other needs around your lab. We offer the same features as big brands without their
        brand name prices without compromising on the quality of our products or our service. We started this company 25
        years ago to make science accessible to everyone, and that&rsquo;s why our prices are so low.&nbsp;</p>

        features and models to sift through, it&rsquo;s tempting to just work with the conventional microscope
        instrument you already have, even when you know you could be doing better.</p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s why we do the leg work for you. Tell us what you need to inspect, and we&rsquo;ll find the best
        microscope for you. We have 25 years of experience helping quality control engineers and inspectors improve
        their processes with better microscopes.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Before you make a capital purchase for your quality control processes, give us a call. Save a chunk of your
        budget and put it towards other needs around your lab. We offer the same features as big brands without their
        brand name prices without compromising on the quality of our products or our service. We started this company 25

      <p>The nature of digital microscopes is especially helpful in the aerospace industry since aerospace engineers
        continuously study new manufacturing processes with new materials to reduce the environmental impacts of their
        products. The flexibility of a digital microscope allows it to adapt well to new shapes and new materials,
        cutting down the amount of time technicians need to spend on preparing parts for examination. </p>

          <h2>How does aerospace and defense quality control benefit from digital microscopes?</h2>

          <p>Although each industry has its own unique list of product defects to hunt down during quality control
            processes, one element is common across the board: excellent quality control demands excellent microscopy.
            With a digital microscope, you make your quality control processes:&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Faster</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Easier</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More traceable</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More accountable&nbsp;</p>

          <p>With the changing demands of quality control, it can be hard to find equipment that lasts a long time and
            adapts well to new QC processes. One of the greatest advantages of digital microscopes is their low
            operating cost and minimal maintenance. Since they aren&rsquo;t built with as many smaller components and
            function partly on a computer, they don&rsquo;t require much intervention and don&rsquo;t have any hidden
            costs either.&nbsp;</p>
