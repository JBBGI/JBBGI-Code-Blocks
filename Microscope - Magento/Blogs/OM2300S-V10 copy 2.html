<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This special offer combines our popular Omano OM118-B4SL LED binocular microscope and our easy-to-use Optixcam Summit Series KK3 1.3MP digital camera, into an affordable and versatile digital microscopy lab, ideal for the home school or classroom setting.  The OM118-B4SL is a binocular compound microscope with four objective lenses and a full, double-layered mechanical stage that optimizes slide handling. In our opinion, a mechanical stage is an indispensable tool for any serious student. The microscope comes with a 5-year Omano Lifetime limited warranty. 

<h4>Optics</h4>
<p>The Omano OM118-B4S includes a binocular microscope head inclined at an ergonomic 45 degrees. The head rotates through 360 degrees for flexible viewing positions. There are two Wide Field WF10x eyepieces that combine with four achromatic objectives lenses, (4x, 40x spring, 100x spring oil immersion) for magnification levels of 40x, 100x, 400x and 1,000x.</p>

<h4>Stage &amp; Focus</h4>
<p>The primary difference between this microscope and the economical Omano OM118-B4 is in the stage. This microscope includes an integrated, double-layered mechanical stage as opposed to a detachable mechanical slide holder on the OM118-B4. In the final analysis, an integrated mechanical stage is the only answer for any serious student or professional microscopist.</p>

<p>While a mechanical slide holder is an improvement on a plain stage, a mechanical stage includes full graduated X/Y movement (18mm x 70mm) with coaxial coarse/fine focus controls. Such coaxial controls enable a student to move the slide without looking up from the eyepiece; for regular users this benefit is an indispensable convenience.<br /><br />Focusing includes high quality rack and pinion mechanics for longer life and coaxial focus controls for easier focusing. We recommend coaxial coarse/fine focus controls since they enable 'eyes down' focusing. In other words, the viewer does not constantly need to look up in order to find the other focus control. This benefit is important in enhancing a student's experience and therefore in encouraging a more sustained interest in the microscope.</p>

<h4>Condenser</h4>
<p>The condenser is Abbe 1.25 N. A with iris diaphragm for optimal adjustments. Transmitted LED illumination includes variable intensity.</p>

<h4>Camera Summary</h4>
<p>The new OptixCam Summit K2 Series KK3-1.3MP digital microscope camera is a terrific way to turn any microscope into a fun and exciting learning tool for kids of all ages. Designed for students and young explorers, this sturdy and affordable little camera will out-perform any other camera in its price range. When used in place of a standard microscope eyepiece, students can now capture vivid images of that sea shell from vacation, the backyard butterfly, a drop of pond water, or Grandpa's coin collection. </p>

<p>It works well with Windows operating systems and the software installs quickly so kids can start capturing images and video. The camera includes a 23.2mm smooth bore ocular mount for mounting on the eyetube or trinocular port of most modern microscopes. We highly recommend this camera for the hobbyist, coin-collector, home-school educator and all general microscopy use.</p>

<h4>Software</h4>
<p>The included K2View software for Windows provides for excellent color rendering and fast image processing especially when capturing multiple images. Simple, intuitive and easy-to-use controls offer image capture, notation, geometric measuring and storage in JPG, BMP, TIFF, RAW format. The software also includes auto white balance, color enhancement, anti-flicker and other image-enhancing benefits. This software is not MAC-compatible.</p>
