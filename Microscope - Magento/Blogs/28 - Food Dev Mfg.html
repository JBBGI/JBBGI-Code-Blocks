      <p>The food industry is among the most regulated industries in the world. With changing legislation like
        ingredient bans, ensuring a safe and legal product is at the top of the list. With the changing demands of the
        industry, it can be hard to find equipment that adapts well to new products and new problems, like identifying
        packaging contaminants in finished food products that can lead to expensive recalls. While some quality control
        and quality assurance companies continue using ocular equipment to complete food analysis, most QC and QA
        professionals are switching to digital microscopes for inspection to:</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Ensure consumer safety and satisfaction</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Protect brand reputations</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Set a high standard for quality control</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Easily Document this entire process while
        they're at it.</p>

      <p>How can a digital microscope benefit you? With the flexibility of modern digital technology and the precise
        nature of traditional microscopy, quality control and inspection can assess the small details that make the most
        significant difference in the quality of manufactured food products.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="text-box">
      <h2>How does food development QC/QA benefit from digital microscopes?</h2>
      <p>These young leaders show us exactly why investing in future scientists is smart and pays back the investment
        many times over.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>They&rsquo;re why Microscope.com is committed to making science exciting and accessible to students (and their
        teachers!), and why we&rsquo;re always looking for ways to help bring the tools for good science into classrooms
        across the USA.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Although each industry has its own unique list of product defects to hunt down during quality control
            processes, one element is common across the board: excellent quality control demands excellent microscopy.
            With a digital microscope, you make your quality control processes:&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Faster</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Easier</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More traceable</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More accountable&nbsp;</p>


          <p>With the changing demands of quality control, it can be hard to find equipment that lasts a long time and
            adapts well to new QC processes. One of the greatest advantages of digital microscopes is their low
            operating cost and minimal maintenance. Since they aren&rsquo;t built with as many smaller components and
            function partly on a computer, they don&rsquo;t require much intervention and don&rsquo;t have any hidden
            costs either.&nbsp;</p>

          training.</strong> Getting highly sophisticated imaging sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s as easy as using
        your smartphone or tablet with a digital microscope. When controls are this familiar, you reduce the training

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you need the microscope for visual inspection
        purposes only, or do you also need to document and report your findings?</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp;How many hours will you use the microscope
        daily?</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Will you have a surface to set your microscope
        down on? What kind of working distance do you need?</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Will you perform inspections in a lab or on the

      <p>The nature of digital microscopes is especially helpful in the aerospace industry since aerospace engineers
        continuously study new manufacturing processes with new materials to reduce the environmental impacts of their
        products. The flexibility of a digital microscope allows it to adapt well to new shapes and new materials,
        cutting down the amount of time technicians need to spend on preparing parts for examination. </p>

          <h2>How does aerospace and defense quality control benefit from digital microscopes?</h2>

          <p>Although each industry has its own unique list of product defects to hunt down during quality control
            processes, one element is common across the board: excellent quality control demands excellent microscopy.
            With a digital microscope, you make your quality control processes:&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Faster</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Easier</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More traceable</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>More accountable&nbsp;</p>

          <p>With the changing demands of quality control, it can be hard to find equipment that lasts a long time and
            adapts well to new QC processes. One of the greatest advantages of digital microscopes is their low
            operating cost and minimal maintenance. Since they aren&rsquo;t built with as many smaller components and
            function partly on a computer, they don&rsquo;t require much intervention and don&rsquo;t have any hidden
            costs either.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Dino-Lite digital USB microscopes are good</h2>

      <p>Digital microscopes, like the Dino-Lite Edge 5.0MP Digital USB Microscope, offer advantages to inspection
        professionals that traditional microscopes can&rsquo;t compete with. And if your microscopy technology lags
        behind a competitor&rsquo;s, so does your quality control, as well as the product under inspection. Digital
        microscopes offer a unique set of features like:</p>


      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;Improved collaboration</strong> across your supply
        chain.&nbsp;With easily viewable, accessible, and shareable image files, digital microscopes allow you to
        improve collaboration and communication across your entire supply chain.&nbsp;</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;Simplified operation</strong> without compromising
        quality.&nbsp;Digital microscopes combine the details of traditional microscopy with digital technology to
        achieve excellent results.&nbsp;</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ease of use</strong> translates into reduced
        training.&nbsp;Getting highly sophisticated imaging sounds complicated, but it&rsquo;s as easy as using
        your smartphone or tablet with a digital microscope. When controls are this familiar, you reduce the
        training required to use new equipment quality control and assurance processes. It makes onboarding new QC
        technicians easy.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ergonomic design</strong> that makes QC and QA
        easier over time.&nbsp;Digital microscopes don&rsquo;t depend on an ocular focus, allowing for comfortable
        and efficient working postures during long days of quality inspection. Technicians no longer need to hunch
        over an eyepiece, straining their eyes and hurting their back for countless hours every week.</p>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp;Imaging software </strong>for trackable
        documentation.&nbsp;Measurement, annotation, and image comparison and analysis have never been easier with
        microscopy software that enhances time-consuming cataloging procedures.&nbsp;</p>
